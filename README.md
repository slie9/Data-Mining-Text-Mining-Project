Our project is an analysis of data from various gacha games using the R programming language. As avid fans of gacha games, we were excited to work on a project that explored this interest. We collected data from four different games and conducted comparisons between them.

To accomplish this, we decided to use R as our primary tool for data analysis. Additionally, we were interested in analyzing Twitter data related to the popular gacha game "Genshin Impact" and its revenue. We scraped Twitter for tweets that contained the hashtags "#GenshinImpact" or "GenshinRevenue" and performed a sentiment analysis on the data.

After cleaning the data, we identified the top 15 unique words that appeared in each type of tweet and the most commonly occurring word pairs. Finally, we created a word network to visualize the relationships between the tweets that used these hashtags.
