# Data-Mining-Text-Mining-Project
This project takes data from different gacha games and is an analysis using R. We have an interest in gacha games and wanted to use this idea for our project. We found this data and decided to make comparisons between 4 different games. We had done some research on what we should do for this project and agreed that using R would be our main method. We wanted to look at Twitter data as well for this project.

In R we scraped Twitter for tweets using the hashtag “#GenshinImpact” or “Genshin Revenue”. Then we did a sentiment analysis with this data. We cleaned and found the top 15 unique words found in each type of tweet. We also found words that occur together the most in tweets. Lastly, we made a word network for tweets using these hashtags.
